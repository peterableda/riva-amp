  This Applied Machine Learning Prototype (AMP) provides a comprehensive audio transcription service
  built on NVIDIA Riva technology. The application offers two primary features:

  1. **Real-time Microphone Recording**: Users can record audio directly through their browser
     microphone and get instant transcription results.

  2. **File Upload Transcription**: Users can upload audio files (WAV format) for batch
     transcription processing.

  The service integrates with a backend NVIDIA Riva endpoint for high-quality speech-to-text
  conversion, supporting multiple languages and delivering accurate transcription results. The
  application handles audio format conversion automatically, ensuring compatibility with the
  Riva service requirements (Mono, 16-bit WAV format).

  Key Features:
  - Browser-based microphone recording
  - Drag-and-drop file upload interface
  - Automatic audio format conversion
  - Multi-language support
  - Real-time transcription feedback
  - Clean, intuitive web interface
